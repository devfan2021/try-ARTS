[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

**Easy** &nbsp;&nbsp; **array** &nbsp;&nbsp; **hash-table**

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

**解答**
本题可以采用常规的方法和基于 hashtab 的方式进行处理(题目描述中已经定义不存在重复的数据)

##### (1).常规解法, 2 层循环，时间复杂度 O(n\*n)

```
result := make([]int, 2)
for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
	var item = nums[i]
	var nextItem = target - item
	for j := i + 1; j < len(nums); j++ {
		if nextItem == nums[j] {
			result[0] = i
			result[1] = j
			break
		}
	}
}
	return result
```

##### (2).基于 Hash，算术运算, 改成 1 层循环，时间复杂度 O(n)， 用空间换时间的思路

```
vMap := make(map[int]int)
for index, item := range nums {
  if _, ok := vMap[target-item]; ok {
    return []int{vMap[target-item], index}
  }
  vMap[item] = index
}
return []int{}
```

## 2.Review

本周阅读的一遍文章是：如何给 6 岁的小孩解释计算机
[Explaining Programming to 6 Years Old Kids](https://dev.to/tkaczanowski/explaining-programming-to-6-years-old-kids)

- Keep them engaged by asking questions and drawing
- Build upon what they already know

tips & tricks

- It was more fun than I expected! I treated this seriously and I was well prepared, and it paid off.
- Drawing pictures is the right way to go.
- Be prepared for repeating things over and over again.
- Some kids will get bored no matter what you do. Their attention span is simply too short.
- Write carefully
- During the presentation I understood that there is no point in correcting them
- The presentation took me ~25 minutes.
