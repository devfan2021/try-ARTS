[485]&nbsp;&nbsp;[Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/)

**Easy** &nbsp;&nbsp; **array**

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example:

```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
  The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

Note:
```
The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
```

**解答**
本题可以采用常规的一次遍历和基于 hashtab 的方式进行处理(题目描述中已经定义不存在重复的数据)

##### (1).常规解法, 一次遍历比较，时间复杂度O(n)，空间复杂度O(1)

```
func findMaxConsecutiveOnes2(nums []int) int {
  maxCount, currentCount := 0, 0

  for _, num := range nums {
    if num == 1 {
      currentCount++
    } else {
      currentCount = 0
    }

    if currentCount > maxCount {
      maxCount = currentCount
    }
  }

  return maxCount
}
```

[how to ace a systems design interview](https://www.palantir.com/2011/10/how-to-rock-a-systems-design-interview/)
* focus on thought process
  * open-ended problems
  * care about is the thought process behind your design choices.
  * come up with the best solution to each.
  * understand the problem:asking questions, sketching diagrams on the board, and bouncing ideas
  * know the constraints?
  * what kind of inputs does your system need to handle
  * you have to get a sense for the scope of the problem.
* topics
  * Concurrency: threads, deadlock, starvation, parallelize algorithms, consistency and coherence
  * Networking: IPC, TCP/IP, the difference between throughput and latency
  * Abstraction: know roughly how an OS, file and database work
  * Real-World Performance: speed of everything: the relative performance of RAM, disk, SSD and your network.
  * Estimation:  back-of-the-envelope calculation
  * Availability and Reliability: cope with network failures, understand durability
* how to prepare
  * Do mock design sessions: Grab an empty room and a fellow engineer, and ask them to give you a design problem, preferably related to something they’ve worked on.
  * Work on an actual system.
  * Do back-of-the-envelope calculations for something you’re building and then write micro-benchmarks to verify them.
  * Dig into the performance characteristics of an open source system. For example, take a look at LevelDB. It’s new and clean and small and well-documented. Read about the implementation to understand how it stores its data on disk and how it compacts the data into levels.
  * Learn how databases and operation systems work under the hood.

## 3.Tip

本周搜索system design primer时，其中采用Anki flashcards来对知识的记录整理，同时由Anki有带出了艾宾浩斯曲线的相关理论知识。目前暂时只是处理了解状态，后续看实际情况再继续深入尝试用下，看实际的效果怎么样。
